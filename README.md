# Eaglercraft 1.12.2 source

This repo contains the source code of my Eaglercraft 1.12 project. While I have made a somewhat functioning version of a desktop runtime, the web version has not yet been compiled. Please be patient as I expect to have a working build soon.

### Compiling

Open this project in IntelliJ and run gradle's clean and build tasks, then look in build/distributions for the compiled runtime zip.

### Web client
As of right now there is no system to compile an offline download, neither is there a web client.

## Pros & Cons

Pros:
- Its a really slimmed down version of the 1.12 client that works
- ITS FREE!
- More features

Cons:
- No web or offline web client or download
- It's pirated
- No dedicated GPU support on Windows (yet)
